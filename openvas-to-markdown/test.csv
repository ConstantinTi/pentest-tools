80.149.53.29,jira01.severin.de,3400,tcp,4.0,Medium,"Mitigation","SSL/TLS: Certificate Signed Using A Weak Signature Algorithm","The remote service is using a SSL/TLS certificate in the certificate chain that has been signed using a
  cryptographically weak hashing algorithm.","The following certificates are part of the certificate chain but using insecure signature algorithms:

Subject:              CN=red_server,O=SEVERIN,L=Sundern,C=de
Signature Algorithm:  sha1WithRSAEncryption

Subject:              1.2.840.113549.1.9.1=#61737461726F407365766572696E2E6465,CN=SEVERIN Remote Ethernet Device CA,O=SEVERIN,L=Sundern,C=de

  SHA-2 signed SSL/TLS certificates to avoid web browser SSL/TLS certificate warnings.","","The following hashing algorithms used for signing SSL/TLS certificates are considered cryptographically weak
  and not secure enough for ongoing use:

  - Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)

  - Message Digest 5 (MD5)

  - Message Digest 4 (MD4)

  - Message Digest 2 (MD2)

  Beginning as late as January 2017 and as early as June 2016, browser developers such as Microsoft and Google will begin warning users when visiting
  web sites that use SHA-1 signed Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates.

  NOTE: The script preference allows to set one or more custom SHA-1 fingerprints of CA certificates which are trusted by this routine. The fingerprints
  needs to be passed comma-separated and case-insensitive:

  Fingerprint1

  or

  fingerprint1,Fingerprint2","Check which hashing algorithm was used to sign the remote SSL/TLS certificate.
